///     A plan draws the overlay from its cut plane to the end of its view range, but the cut of an element covers what lies
///     behind the plane — inside a wall the overlay would not show — and nothing beyond the view range is drawn. Pressed
///     just in front of the cut plane, the geometry is drawn over the cut: a footprint. A floor plan looks down, so what is
///     above the plane comes down to it; a ceiling plan looks up, so what is below goes up to it.
