///         Drawn with DirectContext3D: no elements, no transaction, no undo step, nothing saved. The geometry stays until
///         <see cref="Clear" /> or until its document closes, and is drawn in the 3D views and plans of its document;
///         exported images of a view show it too. A plan presses what lies in front of its cut plane onto it, so a cut
///         element shows as its footprint.
